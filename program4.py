# writing a python function that adds two numbers

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b


# explain me the above code here

# The code defines a function called add_numbers that takes two parameters, a and b.
# The function returns the sum of the two numbers.
# The function is then called with the arguments 10 and 20, and the result is printed.


# Call the function with the parsameters 10 and 20
result = add_numbers(10, 20)

# Print the result
print(result)

# this will return 30
